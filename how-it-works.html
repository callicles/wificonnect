        <p>Websites use TLS encryption as a default, which is great! However that prevents public wifi endpoint,
            like airport wifi, to trigger the DNS redirect that enables you to accept `use conditions` of
            the public wifi.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you don't have an antivirus you usually get a pop up that invites you to accept `use conditions`.
            When you do have an anti-virus, you might not get the pop up.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website gives you an anchor to a non encrypted website, its address is easy to remember, so that you can
            easily access it. It is static, so no need to encrypt anything, interception of any traffic is futile.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is built with 1 single objective in mind, keep an unsecured website online until public endpoint providers
            figure out a better way to provide secure access.
